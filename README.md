# Convert-Decimal-to-Binary
A decimal number is base-10 (0–9). A binary number is base-2 (0 and 1).

Method: Repeated Division by 2
Divide the number by 2
Store the remainder (0 or 1)
Divide quotient again by 2
Continue until quotient becomes 0
Reverse the remainders → binary number
Example: Convert 10 to binary
10 / 2 = 5  remainder 0
 5 / 2 = 2  remainder 1
 2 / 2 = 1  remainder 0
 1 / 2 = 0  remainder 1
Reverse → 1010
